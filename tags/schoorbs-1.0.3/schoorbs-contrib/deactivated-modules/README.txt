All file in this subtree are not ready for Schoorbs Releases, not even 
Alpha-versions, since their functionality coundn't be guranteed due to
the removal or the move of some functions from MRBS to Schoorbs. Some
default behaviour has changed too, so that they might break this software
and create security risks. 

In future it is intended to take a close look at ALL these modules and 
reintegrate them into Schoorbs, but at the moment they shouldn't affect
the release & development process.
