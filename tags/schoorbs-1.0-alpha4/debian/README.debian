#### Quick setup

Hint: The usage of Schoorbs in Debian/Ubuntu is inspired by the way it done with
wordpress. Again thanks to those who made that solution

Setup apache to point to /usr/share/schoorbs. See the examples/apache.conf

#### A little more about the (multiple blog) configuration

The default config.inc.php searches for a configuration filename based
on the Schoorbs' host. This allows you to host more than one Schoorbs installation
on a Debian system.
