All files in this directory need to be rewritten or double-checked if they
should go into Schoorbs. Their functionality may be based on old backends or
the deprecated use or grab_globals.inc. 
All theses files are a security risk at the moment!

In future it is intended to take a close look at ALL these modules and 
reintegrate them into Schoorbs, but at the moment they shouldn't affect
the release & development process.
