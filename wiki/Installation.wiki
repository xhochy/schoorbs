#summary How to install Schoorbs
#labels Phase-Deploy,Featured

== Fresh Install ==

  # Download the latest (stable) Schoorbs release
  # Unpack it to the directory where the webserver finds it
  # Rename the config.inc.php-dist to config.inc.php
  # Edit the config.inc.php, everything should be well described
  # {{{Editors: please continue....}}}

== Update from MRBS 1.2.4 ==

Just copy your old config.inc.php of MRBS into the new Schoorbs directory and everything should work.

== REST-API ==

To use the REST-API you need to have mod_rewrite (or an equivalent) enabled and uncomment the directives in REST/.htaccess. Please check, if you really have mod_rewrite installed, else it would just dont work or you would get an 500 Error from your webserver.
