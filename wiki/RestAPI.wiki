#summary How to communicate with Schoorbs via XML
#labels Phase-Design

With Schoorbs we introduce now a REST-API for usage of Schoorbs with other tools than an ordinary Web browser.

For everybody who doesn't know the system of REST, it's simple. You send a HTTP-GET/POST Query to a specified URL(also called REST-Endpoint) and you receive a simple XML answer.

The endpoint of Schoorbs is `http(s)://schoorbs-installation/REST/` . After the endpoint  you write the function, which should be called, plus a slash, if you would need to give arguments to that function, you can append them after the slash as GET-parameters or you can send them as POST-variables.

Example: `http://schoorbs-installation/REST/getEntriesOfDay/?day=01&year=2007&month=06&room=1&area=1`

*REST-API calls need (at the moment) mod_rewrite or an equivalent to be handled!*

== Functions ==

|| Function || Description ||
|| getEntriesOfDay || Get all entries of a room at a day ||
|| login || check if your login credentials are ok ||
