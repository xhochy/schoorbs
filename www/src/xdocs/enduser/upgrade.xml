      <p>
        <strong>Please backup all your Schoorbs data(files and database) before
        an upgrade!</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
      	<li>We have a Schoorbs installation in ..../schoorbs</li>
      	<li>
      	  Copy the directory of your current Schoorbs-installation to anothter
      	  location, e.g. schoorbs-old
      	</li>
      	<li>Download the new version of Schoorbs</li>
      	<li>
      	  Extract it to the place where your current Schoorbs installation was
      	  before you moved it.
      	</li>
      	<li>
      	  Copy over the following files from the current installation to the new 
      	  installation:
      	  <ul>
      	    <li>config.inc.php</li>
      	    <li>schoorbs-includes/logging.configuration.php</li>
      	  </ul>
      	</li>
      	<li>
      	  Now you are already finsihed, if you want you could delete the files
      	  from the previous Schoorbs installtion which we moved to schoorbs-old.
