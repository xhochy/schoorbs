      <title>What is this about?</title>
      <p>
        A "Facharbeit" is a scholar work which you do in class 11/12 in Germany. You do it in one of 
        your main courses. It is a work which is not connected to the lessons you do at this time in
        school, but it has a precisly defined topic and is a form of long-time homework. I published
        it here to give all of you, who can read german texts, a overview why I forked MRBS and what
        I've done and why. Mainly it discusses security issues but there is a part about the 
        REST-interface and one about the nasty PHP/HTML-mixtures in MRBS. In opposite to the software
        resulted of it, the text of the Facharbeit is not opensource,
