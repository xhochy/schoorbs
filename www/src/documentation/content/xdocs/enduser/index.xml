        While Schoorbs is licensed under the GPL, the end-user documentation is licensed under the 
        "Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported"-license, which is not a strict 
        copyleft license, but is more permissive than the GPL and it isn't a license that was made
        for software cases only. All documentation included in the code of Schoorbs such as the
        API-docs are licensed under the GPL. Some parts of the documentation maybe stripped out of
        the INSTALL, README ... files of MRBS the pages containing those texts do not have a 
        CC-BY-SA-logo at the button and are licensed under the GPL. We want to replace all of the
        GPL-documentation because a single license for the whole end-user documentation is more 
        user-friendly and the old MRBS documentation could be already outdated, we just keep it, 
        to not have undocumented parts of software.
